# Guessing-Game
- This program was created in my Computer Science 1 class
- Functionality
  - It prompts the user to enter the smallest and largest guessable number
  - Then the user can play the game and the program will tell you if the guess is too low/high
  - Once the users guesses right, they can play again or quit, and the program will tell them the statistics of their gameplay
